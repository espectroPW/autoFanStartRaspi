# autoFanStartRaspi


Script to autostart on raspberry pi tho controll fan speed on board with transistor that can controll form 0 to 255 fan voltage from o to 5 volts.
The transistor drain is controll by PWM value form 0 to 3.1 Volts.

Made by my selft to reduce temperature and fan noise.



It use pigpio library and some python scripts.
